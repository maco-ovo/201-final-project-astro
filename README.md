# Final Project — Product Listing Website

Build a product listing website using **Astro**, **TypeScript**, and **OOP**.

You are given:

- `products.json` — your only data source
- This README

---

## What to Build

A site that displays all products and provides an individual detail page for each one. The exact structure, styling, and routing approach are up to you — there is more than one valid way to build this.

At minimum, your project must include:

- A product listing page
- A detail page per product
- Reusable components (e.g. card, grid, layout)
- TypeScript classes that model the data
- At least one interactive feature (Astro island)

Examples of interactive features: filter by category, sort by price, toggle wishlist, hide out-of-stock items.

---

## TypeScript Requirements

- Define an **`interface`** for the product shape (do not use `type` aliases or `any` for this).
- Add explicit **type annotations** on:
  - All class fields and constructor parameters
  - All method parameters and return types
  - All component `Props` definitions
- Function bodies and local variables can rely on inference — annotate boundaries, not internals.

---

## OOP Requirements

You must **not** use raw JSON directly inside UI components. Load JSON through your classes.

You should create at least:

### `Product`
Wraps a single product. Suggested methods: `getFormattedPrice()`, `getSlug()`, `isInStock()`.

### `ProductCatalog`
Wraps the full dataset. Suggested methods: `getAllProducts()`, `getProductBySlug(slug)`, `getProductsByCategory(category)`.

---

## Individual Product Pages

Choose **one** approach and commit to it. Options include:

- Dynamic routes via `[slug].astro` with `getStaticPaths()`
- Category-based routes
- Manually authored static pages
- Any other Astro-supported approach

---

## Reflection (`reflection.md`)

Include a `reflection.md` file at the project root. A few short paragraphs covering:

- Which approach you chose for the product pages
- Why you chose it
- The benefit over the alternatives
- Any limitations or trade-offs
- **The hosted link** to your deployed site (see below)

This is where we evaluate your understanding — be honest and specific.

---

## Deployment

Deploy your project and include the **live hosted URL** at the top of `reflection.md`. Any free static host works — Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, etc. Since the site is static (`npm run build` produces a `dist/` folder), most hosts will pick it up with zero config.

Make sure the live link actually works before submitting.

---

## Technical Rules

- Use Astro + TypeScript + OOP
- Use components, props, and layouts
- Use the provided JSON file as your only data source
- No external APIs, no backend fetching, no hardcoded product data in pages
- **No React, Vue, Svelte, or any UI framework.** This is a vanilla project — interactive features must be built with plain TypeScript / DOM APIs inside an Astro `<script>` tag
- **No reactive state libraries or hooks** (no `useState`, no signals, no stores). Hold state in plain variables and update the DOM directly. Functional/declarative UI patterns are out of scope for this course

---

## Styling & Allowed Libraries

Style the site however you like — plain CSS, scoped `<style>` blocks, a global stylesheet, or a utility framework. You are free to make it look however you want; design and polish are part of the deliverable.

You **may** add:

- **Tailwind CSS** — via `npx astro add tailwind`
- **jQuery** — for DOM manipulation inside your `<script>` tags, if you prefer it over vanilla DOM APIs

You are also free to organize your own folders (e.g. `src/components/`, `src/layouts/`, `src/styles/`, `src/utils/`, `public/images/`) and split your code and assets however makes sense to you. The suggested structure is a starting point, not a rule.

## Evaluation

| Area | Weight |
|---|---|
| Code structure & TypeScript (interfaces, annotations, reusability) | 35% |
| OOP implementation (classes transform JSON into typed objects) | 25% |
| Astro implementation (routing, props, layouts, chosen strategy) | 25% |
| Explanation & `reflection.md` | 15% |

> Good luck!
